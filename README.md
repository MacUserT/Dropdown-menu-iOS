# Dropdown-menu-iOS
This project makes a dropdown menu where you can select multiple items, like in macOS Popup Button. This implementation is in UIKit where there is no equivalent to the pop-op button in macOS. The style of the drop-down button can be adjusted and doesn't necessarily be that large.
